# Quantifying Nonlinear Connectivity

This code provides a framework for analyzing **nonlinear neuronal interactions** using **multi-spectral phase coherence (MSPC)**. It includes simulations and comparisons with existing phase coupling measures. This approach helps advance our understanding of **nonlinear connectivity**, which is essential for characterizing communication between distant neural populations. The MSPC method offers a more detailed and comprehensive characterization of such interactions than traditional metrics.
